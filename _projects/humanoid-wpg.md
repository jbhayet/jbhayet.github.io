In this project, we show how visual constraints such as **homographies and fundamental matrices** can be integrated tightly into the **locomotion controller of a humanoid robot** to drive it from one configuration to another, only by means of images. The visual errors generated by these constraints are stacked as terms of the objective function of a Quadratic Program so as to specify the final target of the robot with a reference image. By using homographies or fundamental matrices instead of specific points, as in previous works, we avoid the features occlusion problem. This image-based strategy has also been extended to solve the problem of following a visual path by a humanoid robot, which allows the robot to execute much longer paths and plans than when using just one reference image.
