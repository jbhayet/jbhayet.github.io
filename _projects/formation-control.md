In this project, we design **algorithms for controlling drones** (quadricopters) which are parts of a swarm so that, by controlling them in a **distributed** way (any drone takes his own decision based on the **sensing information it can gather**), we can ensure that:

* a **desired configuration** of the formation (indicated by relative positions of the drones) is attained;
* the motion of the different robots does not generate any collision, either with another drone or with elements of the map.
